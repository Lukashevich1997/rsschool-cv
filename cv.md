# Hi, I`m Dzmitry Lukashevich

Begginer Front-end Developer.
IT business was interesting topic for me, so once I've decided to try myself in IT.
At the beginning I didn't know which direction to choose, so I have started to collect information about
main trends and most popular programming languages.
I have decided to pay attention to front-end, JS and it pulled me in.
For some period of time I was studing by my own, after that, I learned about the rsscool courses, so here I am.
My main goal is to learn as much as possible about JS and become demanded specialist.
